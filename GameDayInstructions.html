        <b>Game Day and Time</b>
        <br><br>
        You’ve indicated that you’ll be playing your game on <b>December 14th at 10:00AM</b>.  
        <br><br>
        Based on your game date and time, we’ve created this handy instruction list
         to help you get ready for the game and set it up on game day.
        <br><br><br><br>

        <b>8:00AM - Setup the Hospital</b>
        <br><br>
        The Hospital will take some time to set up so let’s get it ready early.  Bring all of the safety suit equipment and place it so the Nurse can easily distribute the equipment to the players when they visit the Hospital after the kickoff.
        <br><br>
        Place the Zombie makeup and shirts in a bag or box so that they are available in the Hospital but not visible to the players.
        <br><br>
        Hang your Hospital Sign on the door of your Hospital location.
        <br><br>
        If you haven’t done already, make sure the Puzzle 1 Safety Suit Instructions have been installed in the pockets of the Safety Suits.
        <br><br><br><br>

        <b>8:10AM - Setup the Armory</b>
        <br><br>
        The Armory is a key location near the end of the game.  You’ll want to leave the nerf guns and bullets you wish to hand out to the surviving humans when they visit the Armory.
        <br><br>
        Hang your Armory Sign on the door of your Armory location.
        <br><br><br><br>

        <b>8:20AM - Setup Puzzles 2 Thru 6</b>
        <br><br>
        You’ll need 20-30 minutes to set up Puzzles 2 thru 6.  Before you leave to install the puzzles, make sure you have all of the puzzles with you.
         You can choose to set up each puzzle in the game order or by location - whichever is most convenient for you.
        <br><br><br><br>
        
        <b>8:50AM - Setup the Signal Flags</b>
        <br><br>
        Next, place the five signal flags in the Puzzle 7 location.  You can control the difficulty of this puzzle by choosing the distance and visibility of the signal flags. 
        <br><br><br><br>

        <b>9:00AM - Setup the Extraction Point</b>
        <br><br>
        Place the Signal Flare at the location of the Extraction Point and end of the game.  Turn the Signal Flare light on.
        <br><br><br><br>

        <b>9:10AM - Game Host and Nurse Costumes</b>
        <br><br>
        The game is now set up.  If you haven’t already, it’s time for you and the Nurse to put on their costumes.
        <br><br><br><br>

        <b>9:30AM - Review</b>
        <br><br>
        It’s now thirty minutes before the game will begin.  This is a good time to review that everything is in place and ready to go.
        <br><br><br><br>

        <b>10:00AM - Game On!</b>
        <br><br>
        Proceed to the Kickoff Location and greet the game’s participants.  When everyone is assembled and ready to play, it’s time for you to give your Bad News Speech to start the game.
