                    Horde will be declared the victors of the game.  If one or more surviving humans reach the Extraction Point with 
                    all five Signal Flags, then they will be declared the victors. Remember that if you are struck with a Nerf Bullet, 
                    you will be stunned and frozen for 5 seconds. After you count 5 Mississippi, you can resume your pursuit of any human."

                    <span class="bigger">Hint</span>:
                    <br>
                    1.  Stay together and work together repel the Zombie horde.
                    <br>
                    2. Bullets are valuable... try to conserve them.
                    <br>
                    3. A bullet hit will stun a Zombie for five seconds... it won't kill them but it will give you time to escape
