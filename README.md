Each Page as a respective HTML and CSS document that need to be in the same directory for functionality  
Stickmen images need to be downloaded in the same directory as well, or else image wont show and alt. text will be displayed instead  
  
If you want to view anything, just download EVERYTHING ONTO THE SAME FOLDER and open up any of the .html documents to view the page!
